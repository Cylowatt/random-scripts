This is a script that installs the latest version of some of the [SleepyVRC Mods](https://github.com/SleepyVRC/Mods) for VRChat without you having to fiddle with replacing DLLs manually.

# Prerequisites
Install [Melon Loader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/) for your VRC.

# How to Get
Download the files in this folder, or just download this whole repository as a zip. To download the whole repository:
- Go [here](https://github.com/Cylowatt/random-scripts)
- On the top right corner above the files click the green "Code" button
- Select "Download ZIP"

# How to Use
- Go to the the `install_sleepy_vrc_mods` folder.
- (optional) Open the `InstallSleepyVrcMods.ps1` and edit the `@DesiredMods` array to fetch more or less DLLs.
- Right-click the `install_sleepy_vrc_mods.bat` batch file, and select "Run as Administrator".

As long as you downloaded all of the files in this folder into the same folder, that should be it!
